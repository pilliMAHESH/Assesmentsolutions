->Data is classified into 2 they are:
    ->continious and Discrete
Continious:there are decimal data ex: Weight of person
Discrete:in this the data is accurate ex:shoe size
--Input varisbales are also called as predictor variables etc  
--Output variables are target or dependent variables

Supervised learning:U will be giving input and output from the data machine shoud come up wth some prediction by understanding relation between input and output.We will be acting as Tecaher

Unsupervisedd learning:U fill feed the machine only with input.no Teacher.This is used when huan expert don't the output.Machine wil taught you.

______--------______
Regerssion Anaysis:It estimate the relation betw input and output

There are 2 types :

1.linear(op is continous):

1.1Simple[1-1 input and output]equation :y=b0+b1x+E
 
1.2.and Multiple[many-one output shoud be Continious]eq:y=b0+b1x1+b2x2.....+bnxn
y-op,x-input,b1- is the coefficient which determine how unit change in x will chane y
b0-intercept

2. and logistic(output isDiscrete)

R-squared value is used to measure the performance of linera regeression.

Higher the R-squared value the better the model is.
